# BadBank
## _Banking Application_

BadBank is a project which was created as part of the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.

## Description
This project is full-stack web application. It allows users to create accounts at this bank, login, make deposits, make withdrawls, view your balance, and even view all user's data. However, authentication will be added at a later date, intended as a capstone project. 

## Features
BadBank allows you to create new users, login to a single user, and deposit and withdraw from individual accounts. There is also a page to see a user's balance, and a page with all data (essentially all transactions in the bank). Future features include authentication/authorization so that all data is not public.

## Tech
BadBank uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [Node.js],
- [React],
- [MongoDB],
- [Express],
- [Bootstrap].

And of course BadBank itself is open source with a [public repository][bb]
 on GitHub.
 
## Clone Project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/stek21/badbank-react.git
```

This command will copy a full project to your local environment.

## Installation
Badbank requires [Node.js] to run.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

cd badbank-react
npm i
node index.js
